# Flindr (Flight Finder)

Flindr is a React Native application that has been developed using Expo Go and React Native. This sophisticated app was created as the culmination of the Mobile Programming course, serving as our final project. Flindr offers a wide range of features that enable users to seamlessly search for and book flights, utilizing a simulated booking system and rewards program. Additionally, users have the ability to conveniently access their booked flights and monitor planes on a radar screen.
